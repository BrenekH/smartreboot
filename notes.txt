     * Check for reboot by running the reboot required scripts
     * Block a reboot by running the block scripts
  * Start and stop controlled by init system (systemd, runit, etc.)

CLI:
  - Usage:
      Commands:
        reboot (-f, --force) - Manually invoke the reboot process, using -f, --force to ignore the block scripts.
